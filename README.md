htmlgames
=========

Games contained in a single HTML page! (Except mines, it uses an old version of
jQuery but at least I got rid of the PHP code).

Most of these were made on road trips when there was no internet access.

- [Dice](dice.html)
- [Minesweeper](mines.html)
- [Nines - card game](nines.html)
- [TicTacToe with unbeatable AI](tictactoe-ai.html)
- [TicTacToe without AI](tictactoe.html)
